          <p>Hi, I'm Danielle Woody (she/her), founder of <em>Evolve | Connection Coaching</em>. My journey has been shaped by over a decade of experience in <strong>restorative practices, student accountability, conflict resolution, and leadership development</strong>.</p>
          
          <p>At <em>Evolve | Connection Coaching</em>, I believe that healing begins with connection, accountability, and love—for ourselves and for those around us. Life's challenges can leave us feeling disconnected, but restoration is always possible.</p>
          
          <p>My mission is to help you restore balance, clarity, and love in your life by using restorative practices that encourage self-reflection, honest communication, personal growth, and meaningful change.</p>

              <p>A Life Coach is trained to listen, to observe, and to customize their approach to each individual client's needs. Certified Life Coaches complete extensive training that teaches them how to ask the right questions, communicate effectively and get to the heart of your needs and desires in life. Coaching is not just limited to helping you achieve your personal or professional goals, it can be so much more.</p>

              <p><strong>Life Coaching:</strong> Focuses on helping clients achieve specific goals, improve communication skills, and foster personal growth. It is goal-oriented, present and future-focused, and emphasizes actionable steps toward desired changes.</p>
              <p><strong>Therapy:</strong> Focuses on healing from past trauma, managing mental health conditions, and developing coping mechanisms. It is often past, present, and future-focused, using clinical techniques to address emotional distress, trauma, or mental health disorders.</p>

              <p>Restorative Practices is an approach rooted in the belief that relationships are central to building healthy communities and that when harm occurs, healing and learning happen best when those relationships are repaired instead of punishment or isolation.</p>
              <p>At its core, restorative practices focus on strengthening relationships, fostering accountability, and creating environments where individuals feel seen, heard, and respected. It is both proactive (building strong connections) and responsive (addressing harm or conflict in ways that restore trust and community).</p>
